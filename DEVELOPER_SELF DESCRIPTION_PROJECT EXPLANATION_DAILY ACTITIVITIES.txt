
HI,
Good morning! I am paramesh, having 3+ years of experience in IT industry working with DWH and BI stream.I am working on MSBI for the last 3 years.
In my tenure I played two major roles.a)Module Lead b)Software Engineer.
I am a Btech qualified candidate with 75% aggregation in academics and even I got good percentages in my earlier qualifications(specify if they are good with institution name).
Worked with various other tools and technologies along with MSBI such as VB Script, Sqlserver, Teradata and Versioning tool TFS. I have some knowledge on scheduling process, control M and Sqlserver Agent
scheduling tools. 
My responsibilities are getting the documents such as Business, HLD,LLD etc...through portals[Sharepoit/Team Foundation Server/FTP] or emails and understanding them to work on or for clarifications. Creating and manipulating packages based on the documents
and Testing them with Data Validation rules.Answering adhoc requests and working on test defects and production issues. I am having good understanding on Datawarehousing and Data Model fundamentals.
Recently trained on Sqlserver 2016 as part of project updgradation.
This is very brief about me.

Retail Project Explanation:
1stpoint:

Currently I am working on a retail project where my customer is AMSI Land Scaping located at Newyark,USA.Their major business is manufacturing various landscape scenes for different real world events such as railroads,
houses and plantation, doll houses, world iconic and important manuments etc...They have many manufacturing units and they sell their products through three channels .
 The first one is retailer, second one direct outlet and the third one is Online.

2nd Point:
Their objective is to have a strategic and tactic analytical system for the analysis of manufacturing units and sales units.

4tyh Poing:
I participated in this project in a DataMart or Application Area called "Inventory and Manufacturing " Analysis.
In this project the warehouse is Oracle which is in Galaxy schema and my application is in SnowFlake schema where I have two fact tables and around 12 dimensions.
They follow bootom up approach of DWH and using Agile life cycle methodology for project implementation.

We prepared packages for DImension and Fact loaing by following dimensional modeling rules based on the HLD and LLD documents of the customers.
Used many transforms, tasks and  constructs of SSIS depending on business logic.Performing Data Validation/ Unit testing post creation of package.
Delivering packages, configuration files and Unit test documents to the customers according their conventional method such as keeping in TFS or Shrepoint Server or EMAIL.

In this project the ETL flow looks like below.
a) Dimensions load from PROJECT_RETAIL_DB
b)Fact Load from Operational Systems with Staging Area

Daily Activities:
============

As soon as I enter into office I open my desktop/Laptop, connect to VPN for customer network and then see my emails for new assignments or change requests or any other kind of requests and meetings.
I will work on the given documents.If already given we work on those documents.

SometimesI work on fresh applications, sometimes on change requests, some times on Test defects and production issues. Even customer adhoc request answered on the fly.

If the work is done, delivering the required documents to the customer through their required communication channel [Web portal/ versioning tool / email/ shared folder]
